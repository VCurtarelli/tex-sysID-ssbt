	In this study we are concerned on system identification using time-frequency transforms. \Cref{sec1:signal_model,sec2:system_identification} are based on \href{https://doi.org/10.1109%2FTASL.2006.889720}{\emph{this paper}}, in order to make the notation clearer and less cumbersome, the steps easier to follow, and highlight its important parts. \Cref{sec3:system_identification_ssbt,appA:development_hlkk'} are adaptations and developments following similar steps to those in the paper, but applied to the SSB transform.
